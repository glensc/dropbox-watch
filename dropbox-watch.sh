# A script that watches ~/Pictures/Screenshots dir, and any new file is added there, it
# is renamed so it would contain filename modify timestamp (uses safe
# characters not to require urlencode) and moved to dropbox dir. Additionally
# dropbox url is copied to clipboard and image viewer is opened to show that
# screenshot.
